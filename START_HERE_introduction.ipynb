    "# Introduction to User Trial\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to my user trial! This trial is part of a thesis project that presents the design and implementation of an explainable AI development environment for processing heterogeneous IoT data. The system leverages knowledge graphs, SAREF ontology, and visualization techniques to provide users with a comprehensive understanding of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a participant, you will have access to a fully customizable environment that is accessible through a web browser and features a familiar JupyterLab interface with per-user persistent data storage. The demo/learning environment consists of a set of Jupyter notebooks that guide you through the process of implementing your own smart connector. You will be asked to edit these notebooks in indicated places by comments like `# EDIT THIS` or similar. Your task will be to add functionality for checking and setting humidity readings, saving them to a graph database, and querying this database via smart connectors of several knowledge bases, all orchestrated by a common knowledge base.\n",
    "\n",
    "After completing the trial, you will be asked to fill out an anonymous questionnaire to provide feedback on your experience. The questionnaire can be accessed at [link to questionnaire](https://forms.gle/Yyn1Jdck4oHiok3QA).\n",
    "\n",
    "I appreciate your participation and feedback as I strive to improve my demo/tutorial. If you have any questions or concerns, please feel free to contact me at m.g.kedzia@student.vu.nl . \n",
    "Thank you for your time and effort! üòä"

    "# Knowledge Engine\n",
    "The Knowledge Engine is a key component of this project, so it's important to understand what it is and what it does. Here's an excerpt from the [Knowledge Engine's GitHub repository](https://github.com/TNO/knowledge-engine) that explains it well:\n",
    "\n",
    "[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/502097185.svg)](https://zenodo.org/badge/latestdoi/502097185)\n",

    "\n",
    "<!-- Welcome to the source code repository of the Knowledge Engine.\n",
    "This README should help you understand what the Knowledge Engine is, and how to use it. -->\n",
    "\n",
    "In short, the Knowledge Engine is an interoperability solution that wants to make it easier for different knowledge bases to communicate.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Knowledge base* is a term to describe \"the system that connects with the interoperability platform\". It can be anything. Examples include, databases, sensors, or even GUIs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Communication is made easier by using concepts from an ontology: a common domain-specific model that the knowledge bases will have to agree upon.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if one knowledge base is interested in some kind of data (e.g., names of dogs: `?dog a ex:Dog . ?dog ex:hasName ?dogName .`), and several other knowledge bases provide such data, the data is automatically gathered and merged when such a query is executed.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Knowledge Engine consists of a number of components:\n",
    "\n",
    "- A *smart connector* is used by knowledge bases to exchange data with other knowledge bases. The smart connector gives the knowledge base a way to (1) register the kind of knowledge they want to exchange and in which way, and (2) do the actual knowledge exchange.\n",
    "- A *Knowledge Engine runtime* is a runtime in which one or more smart connectors can exist. These can exchange data with eachother, and, **if configured correctly**, also with smart connectors in other Knowledge Engine runtimes.\n",
    "- (optional) A *knowledge directory* is used as a simple discovery mechanism for several Knowledge Engine runtimes to become aware of eachother's existence."
