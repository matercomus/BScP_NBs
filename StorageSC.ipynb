    "# StorageSC: Smart Connector for Storing and Serving Humidity and Temperature Measurements\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook is a knowledge base and smart connector for storing humidity and temperature measurements in a remote GraphDB triples database. GraphDB is a highly-efficient and scalable RDF database that allows you to link diverse data, index it for semantic search, and enrich it via text analysis to build big knowledge graphs.\n",
    "\n",
    "StorageSC has two react knowledge interactions that are triggered when the graph pattern of the post knowledge interactions from the smart connector knowledge base gets matched by the knowledge engine with the graph pattern of these react knowledge interactions. These interactions handle the bindings sent by the post side by matching them with the graph pattern and storing that in the GraphDB.\n",
    "\n",
    "StorageSC also has two answer knowledge interactions for querying the GraphDB for temperature and humidity measurements made in a specified datetime range. These interactions are triggered by ask knowledge interactions coming from another notebook. The ask side sends bindings specifying the datetime range, which are then used by the answer side to query the GraphDB and return the requested measurements.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, this notebook provides a smart connector for storing and serving humidity and temperature measurements in a remote GraphDB triples database. It receives live measurements from another smart connector notebook, stores them in the GraphDB, and allows querying for measurements made in a specified datetime range."
