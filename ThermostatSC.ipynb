    "# Smart Connector for Thermostat API\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook acts as a translation layer between the thermostat API and a knowledge engine. It serves as a knowledge base and registers with the knowledge engine using functions `register_post_knowledge_interaction` and `register_react_knowledge_interaction`. In turn, it receives an ID for each interaction that is necessary to post or handle a react.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two types of interactions: POST/REACT and ASK/ANSWER. When the graph pattern of this smart connector's post_knowledge_interaction gets matched by the knowledge engine with the graph pattern of another knowledge base's react_knowledge_interaction, the post side sends bindings that are then received and handled by the react side. ASK/ANSWER interactions will be explained in further notebooks.\n",
    "\n",
    "This smart connector has four main knowledge interactions:\n",
    "\n",
    "## `(POST)` \"post-temp-measurements\" \n",
    "\n",
    "This knowledge interaction is used to post live temperature measurements to the knowledge engine. It takes the current temperature as measured by the thermostat API, constructs bindings describing the measurement, and sends them to the knowledge engine. This interaction runs in a separate thread in the background.\n",
    "\n",
    "## `(REACT)`  \"set-desired-temp\" \n",
    "\n",
    "This knowledge interaction changes the desired temperature of the thermostat. When triggered, it calls a function that takes a list of bindings as an argument. This function logs a message indicating that it is changing the desired temperature to the value specified in the binding. Then, it sends a PUT request to the thermostat API's `/desired_temperature` endpoint with the desired temperature value as a query parameter to update the desired temperature of the thermostat. This interaction is handled by the main thread, which is occupied by a handle_loop that handles react KIs.\n",
    "\n",
    "## `(POST)` \"post-humidity-measurements\"\n",
    "\n",
    "This knowledge interaction is used to post live humidity measurements to the knowledge engine. It takes the current humidity as measured by the thermostat API, constructs bindings describing the measurement, and sends them to the knowledge engine. This interaction runs in a separate thread in the background.\n",
    "\n",
    "## `(REACT)`  \"set-desired-humidity\"\n",

    "\n",
    "All four KIs have their own RDF graph patterns that describe them using the SAREF ontology. These graph patterns are string constants and are hardcoded when registering them with the knowledge engine. After that, only bindings are set and received. These graph patterns can be used by the knowledge engine to interact with this smart connector and other similar knowledge bases."

    "Before running the next cell, make sure that you have completed all the previous steps and edited the code cells as instructed, including implementing the humidity post and handling react to desired humidity.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Run the code and check the output logs.\n",
    "If everything is working correctly, you should see log messages indicating that temperature and humidity measurements are being posted to the knowledge engine every 5 seconds.  \n",
    "\n",
    "You will also see log messages indicating that the desired temperature and humidity are being changed when the `handle_react_change_desired_temp` and `handle_react_change_desired_humidity` functions are triggered by post knowledge interactions with matching graph bindings.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the log messages indicating that the desired temperature and humidity have been changed (`Changing desired temperature to: 7` and `Changing desired humidity to: X`) are triggered by changing the desired values using the UI smart connector (the next notebook), so you will not see them until you have completed the next notebook.  \n",

    "It's important to note that a log message like `2023-06-27 14:27:21 INFO {\"messageType\":\"error\",\"message\":\"Deletion of knowledge base failed, because it could not be found.\"}` is not an error to be concerned about. This message is generated because the code tries to delete a knowledge base with the same ID before registering it, in order to avoid errors. If the knowledge base with the specified ID does not exist, this log message will be generated, indicating that the deletion of the knowledge base failed because it could not be found. This is expected behavior and is not a cause for concern.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you see log messages similar to those shown in the example output, then your code is working correctly and you have successfully implemented a system for posting live temperature and humidity measurements to the knowledge engine and handling react knowledge interactions for changing the desired temperature and humidity. Great job! 😊\n",
